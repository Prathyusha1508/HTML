        <p>The <b>Shih Tzu </b> a sturdy dog with a small <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snout#Dogs"> muzzle </a> normally has large dark brown eyes. The Chinese have described their head shapes as "owl head" and "lion head", and their mouth as "frog mouths". They have a soft and long double coat that will tangle and mat easily if not brushed at least every 2 or 3 days. A Shih Tzu should stand no more than 26.7 cm (101‚ÅÑ2") at the withers and with an ideal weight of 4.0 to 7.5kg (9 to 17 lb). Their floppy ears are covered with long fur, and their heavily fur-covered tail is carried curled over the back. The coat may be of any colour, though white and with blazes of grey are frequently seen. A very noticeable feature is the underbite, which is required in the breed standard</p>
